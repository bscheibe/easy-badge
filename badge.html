<ul>
  <li>Upload an image (with a ratio of 1:1) to a site that hosts images (Eg. Imgur)</li>
  <li>Provide the direct link to the image (on Imgur this is called the 'Direct Link' in the sidebar)</li>
  <li>Note if the image is larger than 100&#42;100, EasyBadge will resize the image and the quality could possibly be reduced</li>
  <li>Therefore try to upload badges than are originally 100&#42;100</li>
  <li>You may have to play around with different sizes (such as 90&#42;90) to get the crop that works best</li>
  <li><b>Note:</b> Imgur provides easy access to crop and resize your image by clicking 'Edit Image'</li>
