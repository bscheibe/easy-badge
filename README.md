Upload an image (with a ratio of 1:1) to a site that hosts images (Eg. Imgur)
Provide the direct link to the image (on Imgur this is called the 'Direct Link' in the sidebar)

OR

Upload an image (with a ratio of 1:1)

Note: If the image is larger than 100*100, EasyBadge will resize the image (quality could be reduced)
Note: To make sure you don't lose quality, try to upload badges than are originally 100*100
Note: You may have to play around with different sizes (such as 90*90) to get the crop that works best
Note: Imgur provides easy access to crop and resize your image by clicking 'Edit Image'
Note: Currently this badge creator only overlays the image. So no 3D badge creations are available
Note: At this time we only support .PNG & .GIF due to limitations of the Heroku hosting
