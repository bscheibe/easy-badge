easy-badge
==========

Used for creating easy badges with fancy rims

As of now all you have to do is delete the original picture.png and enter a 100px*100px image of your own. 

You can change the image size in windows photo viewer or preview in mac

then open up the html file, take a screenshot of the screen, and then crop the image again in either whatever program of your choice (say windows photo view or preview again) to around the badge

then upload in Salesforce or any other software that uses badges
